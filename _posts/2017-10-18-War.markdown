I am the man swelling below and churning above. I am the man ready to smother a face with a hard blow and the man who avoids altercation based on calculations of risk. Dreams of being a benevolent patriarch, but curses those I need to do so when I don't get my way. The great dragon, the demon beast, fills me with his dark yet fiery lust and violent volatility from below. The humble teacher and the great father of light bestow patient reason and forward momentum on me from above. The dialectical war brews within. A battle. A truce. An arms race. The foes spur one another to develop their capability for domination with the passing of time. But, out of this comes a man, deeper and more complex. Who one day must assimilate of both archetypes for individuation to occur. Finally, he will become something like an Ã¼berman only to realize that there is no such thing, but the striving in itself is the mechanism of man's evolution.
