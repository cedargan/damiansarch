# Hello
## Welcome To The Mind of a Fool.

People in the past, famous people at least, seem to have kept extensive journals. Now my original purpose was not to document the rants of a narcissistic philosopher wanna-be. I'm making this to dive deeper into my own psyche.
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
