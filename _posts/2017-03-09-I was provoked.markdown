# Hello
## Welcome To The Mind of a Fool.

People in the past, famous people at least, seem to have kept extensive journals. Now my original purpose was not to document the rants of a narcissistic philosopher wanna-be. I'm making this to dive deeper into my own psyche. It seems that now I have things up and running to the slightest extent possible. Now back to my mind.I feel like I want to be free like Crazy Horse. I want to be a warrior. My chance is coming to prove myself within my own society. I not really sure which figure best represents who I am. Sometimes I'm drawn to the warrior archetype and other times I'm drawn the medicine man archetype.There is a portion of my mind that tells me I’m nothing. It telling we I can never choose between the two, because choosing one is the death of the other. What utter nonsense! I should simple do what I’m good at. I’m good at this. I’m not the best at the moment, but I’m better at computer and philosophy related subjects than I am at other things in comparison to other people. Damn, I really must get used to mechanical keyboards. I can’t wait to become the beastly warrior I aspire to be. The name Damian means 'one who tames; subdues' I want to subdue the bitch inside of me. People just don’t understand, and perhaps their issue is not as severe as my own. Nonetheless, modern people, many of us, need to tame the lazy bitch inside and raise the ferocious beast. Subdue the bitch. Raise the beast. Tame the beast to do constructive things that no normal man could even dream of achieving. Raise the beast!
