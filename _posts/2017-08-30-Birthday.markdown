I feel as if I just wasted a small portion of my life reading this teaching methods guide. It will be useful though. The teaching methods at my current and new job are rediculously strict. I'm sure it will benifit my understanding of everything in the long run. Everything sort of translates in that way. If something works in one particular areana, chances are it will work in another.

My birthday is coming up. I'm having trouble coming up with something I want. A birthday is a chance for a married man to get something more expensive than usual. Something a wife may not approve of under normal circumstances. So my first impulse was to get some computer shit. I was thinking a 4 port usb 3.0 pcie add-on thing, but it's a little too cheap. Not worth getting as a brithday gift. I thought about getting a watch, but I the watch I want is also pretty cheap. Around sixty dollars.

Want I really want is... want I really want is fun. The sexy kind. Not just out right sex, but a more erotic relationship with Ayeon now till sickness or death do us part. I'm not really sure if this is possible. If only it were. I'm sure it is, but how? I'm sure it is though. But maybe this shouldn't be a birthday thing. But this is what I would ask for. I think I will ask anyways. I'm so greedy to ask something of someone that will last the rest of her life. Am I greedy? No, this is not only a gift to me. It will likely end up being something that I will have to put a lot of effort into getting. But maybe not. I won't know till I ask. Just hope for the best.

I've been playing around with the idea only saying things that make me stronger. This is obviously good. And of course I immediately expanded that to include only do, think and eat things that make me stronger. I immediately jumped from a good idea to a set of impossible rules. The next step for me would of course be to say I can't do it and give up. So I've decided to just focus on the speech aspect alone.
